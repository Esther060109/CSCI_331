Zip Code Group Project 2.0 - User Document
---------------------------------------

Build:
  g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp buffer.cpp PrimaryKeyIndex.cpp -o zipcode_app

Files:
  - <dataFile> : length-indicated CSV-like file (header + records)
  - <indexFile>: primary key index text file created by the program

Interpretation of output:
  - For each found ZIP, program prints a labeled single record:
    ZIP: 56301
    Place Name: SomePlace
    State: MN
    County: SomeCounty
    Latitude: 45.1234
    Longitude: -93.1234
  - If not found:
    ZIP 99999 not found in index.

Notes:
  - The program keeps only the index in RAM and one record at a time (per search).
  - The length-indicated data file must have a header (first line) and then one record per line.
  - Index files are text CSV: zip,offset\n where offset is a byte offset into data file.
